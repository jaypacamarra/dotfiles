# dotfiles
These are the configuration files for my preferred development environment.

## Requirements
- Vim >= 0.9.0
- GNU Stow >= 2.0.0

## Install
This will create symlinks to the target directory defined in the stow directory.

For example, you can install the neovim configuration with:
```
stow nvim
```

## Uninstall
This will remove the symlinks that was created with `stow`
```
TODO
```
